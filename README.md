# Electronic-Voting-Machine

Project to simulate an electronic voting machine using the microcontroller LPC2148. The external peripherals such as LCD for displaying candidates and their votes, LED for indicating button press, and switches acting as buttons for each candidates are connected to LPC2148. 

The embedded code used to program the microcontroller LPC2148 in a simulating software environment such as Proteus is written using Keil4 IDE. The program code presets the value of the no. of candidates in a selected constituency. It is assumed to be 3 and hardcoded in the program. 

The final results are printed in a virtual terminal displaying the winning candidate and a congratulatory message.
